SQL-Train is a learning platform created by students for students, where you can
execute and solve SQL tasks directly in your browser. The Tool can be integrated
in to LMSs via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability).

This project was part of the summer term projects 2023 of the
[Augsburg Technological University of Applied Sciences](https://th-augsburg.de)[^1]
and was supervised by Prof. Dr. Matthias Kolonko.

## Get Started

### Version Compatibility

| Python | Node | Libpq |
| ------ | ---- | ----- |
| >=3.9  | >=16 | >=15  |

### Setup

```bash
npm install --prefix frontend/
npm run build --prefix frontend/
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create an `.env` file and set all the variable from `.env-testing`. Copy
`config.json.example` to `config.json` and set values if needed.

### Create Database Schema

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Load Example Data

_Unfortunately we cannot release the exercises from the internal gitlab 
submodule because we do not have the copyright._

In order to populate the website with exercises, some example data has been
provided that can be loaded into the database.

```bash
cp example_exercises/* exercises_data/ # copy the exercises to the MEDIA_ROOT
python manage.py loaddata exercises_data/*.yaml # load the exercises
```

### Create Admin Account

To use the website locally, you need to create a superuser (admin) account that
will allow you to manage the database.

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Start Application

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

After launching the frontend for the first time, you need to log in to
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) using the superuser
account you just created in order to establish a connection to the website. Then
you can use the app at the [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

See
[here](https://hochschule-augsburg.github.io/SQL-Train/admin/index.html)
for deployment in production.
